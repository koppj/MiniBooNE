# MiniBooNE
Analysis codes related to MiniBooNE background studies

These are the Python codes on which Vedran Brdar's and Joachim Kopp's paper
"An Altarelli Cocktail for the MiniBooNE anomaly?" is based.

The Jupyter notebook gibuu-analysis-mb.ipynb provides a unified framework
for analyzing output from different event generators (GENIE, GiBUU, NUANCE,
NuWro) and includes in particular the codes used to produce figs. 1-5 in the
paper.

For the actual Monte Carlo output files (> 100 GB), and for information
on the global fitting code used to produce figs. 6-10, please contact
the authors (jkopp@cern.ch).
